Ad-hoc Ma√ünahmen
1. When human does not output enough speed/effort:
a) do not update wish-weight
animateGMM.m in weight update: if abs(z(1))<0.25, weight = last_w;
b) the observation update of target position should be reduced
animateGMM.m in ekf: weight_adjust = [z_ratio*weight(i_comp)...
2. When one of the wish-weight is low
a) the observation update of target position should be reduced
animateGMM.m in ekf: weight_adjust = [z_ratio*weight(i_comp)...
3. belief has too much noise, affecting feedback control
feedback K * 0.3
